 Development version
=====================

This document describes in-flight development work.

    Please do not edit this file by hand (doing so will likely cause merge
    conflicts for other Pull Requests). Instead, create a new file in the

Using different kernels
-----------------------

.. image:: ../_images/kernel_selector_screenshot.png
   :alt: Screenshot of notebook kernel selection dropdown menu
   :align: center

You can now choose a kernel for a notebook within the user interface, rather
than starting up a separate notebook server for each kernel you want to use. The
syntax highlighting adapts to match the language you're working in.

Information about the kernel is stored in the notebook file, so when you open a
notebook, it will automatically start the correct kernel.

It is also easier to use the Qt console and the terminal console with other
kernels, using the --kernel flag::

    ipython qtconsole --kernel bash
    ipython console --kernel bash

    # To list available kernels
    ipython kernelspec list

Kernel authors should see :ref:`kernelspecs` for how to register their kernels
with IPython so that these mechanisms work.

Typing unicode identifiers
--------------------------

.. image:: /_images/unicode_completion.png

Complex expressions can be much cleaner when written with a wider choice of
characters. Python 3 allows unicode identifiers, and IPython 3 makes it easier
to type those, using a feature from Julia. Type a backslash followed by a LaTeX
style short name, such as ``\alpha``. Press tab, and it will turn into Î±.

Other new features
------------------

* :class:`~.TextWidget` and :class:`~.TextareaWidget` objects now include a
  ``placeholder`` attribute, for displaying placeholder text before the
  user has typed anything.

* The %load magic can now find the source for objects in the user namespace.
  To enable searching the namespace, use the ``-n`` option.

  .. sourcecode:: ipython

      In [1]: %load -n my_module.some_function

* :class:`~.DirectView` objects have a new :meth:`~.DirectView.use_cloudpickle`
  method, which works like ``view.use_dill()``, but causes the ``cloudpickle``
  module from PiCloud's `cloud`__ library to be used rather than dill or the
  builtin pickle module.

  __ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloud

* Added a .ipynb exporter to nbconvert.  It can be used by passing `--to notebook`
  as a commandline argument to nbconvert.

* New nbconvert preprocessor called :class:`~.ClearOutputPreprocessor`. This
  clears the output from IPython notebooks.

* New preprocessor for nbconvert that executes all the code cells in a notebook.
  To run a notebook and save its output in a new notebook::

      ipython nbconvert InputNotebook --ExecutePreprocessor.enabled=True --to notebook --output Executed

* Consecutive stream (stdout/stderr) output is merged into a single output
  in the notebook document.
  Previously, all output messages were preserved as separate output fields in the JSON.
  Now, the same merge is applied to the stored output as the displayed output,
  improving document load time for notebooks with many small outputs.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* :func:`IPython.core.oinspect.getsource` call specification has changed:

  * `oname` keyword argument has been added for property source formatting
  * `is_binary` keyword argument has been dropped, passing ``True`` had
    previously short-circuited the function to return ``None`` unconditionally

* Removed the octavemagic extension: it is now available as ``oct2py.ipython``.

* Creating PDFs with LaTeX no longer uses a post processor.
  Use `nbconvert --to pdf` instead of `nbconvert --to latex --post pdf`.

* Used https://github.com/jdfreder/bootstrap2to3 to migrate the Notebook to Bootstrap 3.

  Additional changes:

  - Set `.tab-content .row` `0px;` left and right margin (bootstrap default is `-15px;`)
  - Removed `height: @btn_mini_height;` from `.list_header>div, .list_item>div` in `tree.less`
  - Set `#header` div `margin-bottom: 0px;`
  - Set `#menus` to `float: left;`
  - Set `#maintoolbar .navbar-text` to `float: none;`
  - Added no-padding convienence class.
  - Set border of #maintoolbar to 0px

* Accessing the `container` DOM object when displaying javascript has been
  deprecated in IPython 2.0 in favor of accessing `element`. Starting with
  IPython 3.0 trying to access `container` will raise an error in browser
  javascript console.

* ``IPython.utils.py3compat.open`` was removed: :func:`io.open` provides all
  the same functionality.

* The NotebookManager and ``/api/notebooks`` service has been replaced by
  a more generic ContentsManager and ``/api/contents`` service,
  which supports all kinds of files.
* The Dashboard now lists all files, not just notebooks and directories.
* The ``--script`` hook for saving notebooks to Python scripts is removed,
  use :samp:`ipython nbconvert --to python {notebook}` instead.

* The ``rmagic`` extension is deprecated, as it is now part of rpy2. See
  :mod:`rpy2.ipython.rmagic`.

* :meth:`~.KernelManager.start_kernel` and :meth:`~.KernelManager.format_kernel_cmd`
  no longer accept a ``executable`` parameter. Use the kernelspec machinery instead.

* The widget classes have been renamed from `*Widget` to `*`.  The old names are
  still functional, but are deprecated.  i.e. `IntSliderWidget` has been renamed
  to `IntSlider`.
* The ContainerWidget was renamed to Box and no longer defaults as a flexible
  box in the web browser.  A new FlexBox widget was added, which allows you to
  use the flexible box model.

IFrame embedding
````````````````

The IPython Notebook and its APIs by default will only be allowed to be
embedded in an iframe on the same origin.

To override this, set ``headers[X-Frame-Options]`` to one of

* DENY
* SAMEORIGIN
* ALLOW-FROM uri

See `Mozilla's guide to X-Frame-Options <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/X-Frame-Options>`_ for more examples.
