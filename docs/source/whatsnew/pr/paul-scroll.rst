* A ``ScrollManager`` was added to the notebook.  The ``ScrollManager`` controls how the notebook document is scrolled using keyboard.  Users can inherit from the ``ScrollManager`` or ``TargetScrollManager`` to customize how their notebook scrolls.  The default ``ScrollManager`` is the ``SlideScrollManager``, which tries to scroll to the nearest slide or sub-slide cell.
